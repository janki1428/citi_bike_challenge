# Analysis

The number of riders is higher during summer and fall, which can be due to the nice weather. 


The most popular/ top 10 start and end stations can mostly be found in New Jersey zipcode 07302 since this 
area is mostly residential homes and most of the roads have bike lanes.


The bottom 10 start stations are more spread out throughout 3 different zip codes,
while the bottom 10 end stations are spread out throughout several zip codes because these 
zip codes are very close to each other and their roads have bike lanes, which allows riders 
to easily bike from onezip code to another.


In addition, people born between 1980 and 2000 represent the highest number of riders. However, 
people born after 1990 have a higher average trip duration. This can mean that younger riders enjoy 
riding the Citi bike more; they have more energy to ride it for a longer period, and use it to help them 
to get to places they need to go, such as going to work/ school, grocery shopping, and spending time with family and friends. 


Even though there are more subscribers than customers, customers have a higher average trip duration than subscribers.
This could signal a growing interestin short-term rentals for users who want to experience the CitiBike product without 
having to commit for a whole year, or perhaps even a growing tourist market.


Overall, there is steady ridership growth across user types, suggesting a healthy demand for CitiBikes. 
Current year-to-date growth rates also suggest a growing market for short-term rentals.
Therefore, recommendations would be to focus marketing campaigns towards those users.
